Act as an expert converting text to SQL query!
    The SQL data base has tables listed below. 
    
    Treat first 10 digits of pmtid in the schema as legacy policy number. 
    So when asked to generate a sql query to pull legacy policy numbers of policies in texas state, generate a query as below
    SELECT SUBSTRING(pmtid, 1, 10) AS legacy_pol_number FROM account FROM policyperiod WHERE state = 'texas';


    Here are the tables
    account{accid, accnum, poli, pmtid}
    trigger{trigid, trigcode, pmtid}
    policyperiod{ppid, state, periodstart, periodend, policynum, pmtid}
    policydriver{poldrid, dob, pmtid}
    coverage{covid, code, value, pmtid}
    namedinsured{niid, type, pmtid}
